<h2 id="sec-1">The Project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Typically, even my pet projects have a specific goal in mind. I don&#8217;t write a spec for my personal projects, there&#8217;s just a, maybe slightly fuzzy, goal. Generally I want something that will be useful. I&#8217;ll work on a project until:
</p><ul>
<li>The project does everything I hoped for. Maybe even more!
</li>
<li>I run out of spare time to work on it. This doesn&#8217;t happen as often as you may imagine. I really enjoy coding. So, after a tiring day of coding at the office, I come home to relax and work on one of my pet projects. If it was any different, then I have no right to call my blog <a href="http://bit.ly/yGGszW">My Geekdom</a>. 
</li>
<li>I decide that I did a poor job picking a pet project as they&#8217;re supposed to be fun and this projects isn&#8217;t. So long!
</li>
<li>I get stuck such that proceeding will require more effort than I feel it&#8217;s worth. That said, hopefully I learned something working on the project.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
But, unlike my typical pet projects, my goal with my new project is rather amorphous. I want to analyze some data. At time of writing this, I have just shy of 5K records totally 181MB of data. 
</p>
<p>
Leaving the details for a later posting, each record is a snapshot of the state of my <a href="http://bit.ly/Kfv0n2">Mac OS X</a> computer. I&#8217;ve been collecting, and am continuing to collect, samples every five minutes since the beginning of March. At least every five minutes that my computer isn&#8217;t <a href="http://bit.ly/LUSEY8">sleeping</a> or hanging.
</p>
<p>
I decided to collect the samples because I was getting downright frustrated with the performance of <a href="http://bit.ly/LUT7tx">Mozilla</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://bit.ly/HzqbTy">Firefox</a> browser. For reasons that are off-topic for this posting, I feel a strong interest in making sure that Firefox continues to be successful. 
</p>
<p>
For years I thought Firefox was the bomb. Starting about 9-12 months ago I started to notice that Firefox was routinely using all the resources on my computer. This concerned me because <a href="http://bit.ly/LUUGHN">Google</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://bit.ly/LUUHLP">Chrome</a> browser was starting to have enough functionality to be a primary browser.
</p>
<p>
Being that I wanted Firefox to stay competitive, I decided to try to stay with it. As Mozilla changed their release model, I started to use <a href="http://bit.ly/LUV1u1">Aurora</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/LUV4Ga">Firefox Beta</a> and provide lots of feedback. The newer versions also seemed to consume a more reasonable amount of my computer&#8217;s resources. Being that the Firefox team was working hard at fixing performance problems, especially memory leaks, I stayed with Firefox. (See <a href="#sec-5">Reference: Articles About Firefox&#8217;s Memory Leaks And Repair Efforts</a> for information about FF&#8217;s memory leaks.)
<!-- more -->

Around the beginning of this calendar year I started to think that Firefox wasn&#8217;t getting faster and may have been getting slower. That said, I can be a pretty heavy user of my computer. Running FF with a couple of dozen add-ons is typical. Also, my experience with performance tuning has taught me that I don&#8217;t know enough to make accurate guesses. Guessing can be used to lead your performance tuning investigations, but you always need hard data.
</p>
<p>
After a bit of thought, I decided to collect some data and see if I can convince myself that Firefox is or is not the problem. There are, of course, simpler solutions to tracking a performance problem than sampling your entire process every five minutes for months. But this is a pet project. It wouldn&#8217;t be any fun if I just switched from Firefox to Chrome to see if I notice a difference.
</p>
<p>
Now that I have accumulated a few months of the data, I need to try to analyze the data and see what, if any, conclusions I can make from it. I have some ideas about where to start my data analysis and will just need to follow the path they outline. In short, I&#8217;m prepared to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyverism#MacGyverisms">MacGyver</a> the analysis as I go along.
</p>
<p>
My new pet project is the exploration of these data samples.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The Programming Language</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Forensic performance analysis is never simple. For this project I anticipate that the difficulties will be in determining what types of data analyses are required. I&#8217;m hoping the actual coding will be relatively simple as there is no need for network interaction, provide real time responses, or even have a <a href="http://bit.ly/n1i2v2">GUI</a>. As long as I don&#8217;t need to do very complex statistical analyses, the choice programming language won&#8217;t likely matter to much.
</p>
<p>
So I have chosen to implement this project in <a href="http://bit.ly/LUK5N0">Ruby</a>. I&#8217;m certain I could implement it faster in any of a few dozen other programming languages but I chose Ruby for two reasons:
</p><ol>
<li>This is a personal project. One of my main goals is to have fun. Being that I don&#8217;t know Ruby, learning it will be more fun. Especially being that I haven&#8217;t learned a new language in a year or so.
</li>
<li>Ruby is a new-ish language, growing in popularity, likely to be around for awhile, so it seems like something I should learn or at least be familiar with.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Ruby isn&#8217;t wholly unfamiliar to me. I&#8217;ve made a few small (very small) changes to the <a href="http://bit.ly/JBwXrU">org-ruby</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/M5PRvb">gem</a>. Based on that experience, I think that the syntax of Ruby is kind of strange but the functionality it provides seems comparable to other languages such as C and Java. I just have to learn the new syntax. Unlike C and Java, Ruby has <a href="http://bit.ly/M5T4ei">dynamic typing</a>. But languages that I&#8217;m fluent in, such as Lisp, Python, Bash, and AWK have dynamic typing. Doesn&#8217;t seem a problem.
</p>
<p>
But the structure of a Ruby application, at least the structure of the org-ruby gem, feels different to me than the structure of programs I&#8217;ve seen in other languages. Sure Ruby has classes and modules and functions and inheritance as many other languages do. But the design of the org-ruby gem feels a bit unusual to me. 
</p>
<p>
I think that part of the atypicality of the design of the org-ruby gem is that it is a parser that is written in a manner that is not familiar to me. I have a strong background in designing and implementing programming languages, their associated runtimes, IDE&#8217;s, and such. In my world, there are only a few ways to implement a <a href="http://bit.ly/JBxKsI">parser</a> and org-ruby doesn&#8217;t use any of them. 
</p>
<p>
That said, I don&#8217;t think the feeling of unfamiliarity stems from org-ruby&#8217;s parser not being a <a href="http://bit.ly/JBxTfU">recursive descent parser</a> or implemented with a <a href="http://bit.ly/JBxXMI">parser generator</a> from a <a href="http://bit.ly/JBxYAi">formal grammar</a>. I&#8217;ve seem plenty of really terrible parser implementations that left queasy but didn&#8217;t feel unfamiliar.
</p>
<p>
Not only do I not think that org-ruby gem is terrible, I think it has a certain elegance to its design. 
</p>
<p>
Having eliminated other possibilities, I&#8217;m left to think that the feeling of unfamiliarity must stem from Ruby itself.
</p>
<p>
For example, C and Pascal have a similar feel when you use them. So too do <a href="http://bit.ly/JByk9Q">object oriented</a> languages such as Java and C++. While not OO, C and Pascal are somewhat similar to Java and C++. But a Scheme application doesn&#8217;t feel anything like a C application (at least not if you understand how to program in Scheme). While I don&#8217;t have a word for it, I think that Ruby leads to a different way of writing applications than languages that I&#8217;m familiar with.. 
</p>
<p>
While I&#8217;m not sure what that difference is, I hope to figure it out as I move through this project. In the end, I don&#8217;t want to have a great &#8220;Java program&#8221; that happens to have been written using Ruby syntax. I want to have a great Ruby program &ndash; period.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>&#8220;Not much&#8221; seems to sum up my current project. While I&#8217;ve been collecting data for months and easing myself into Ruby by working on the org-ruby gem, I just started coding for this project a few hours ago. All I&#8217;ve done so far is write a tiny class to hold a line of data output by the <a href="http://bit.ly/M5V9H3">ps(1)</a> program:
</p>


<pre class="src src-ruby-mode"><span class="linenr"> 1:  </span>class PSDataLine
<span class="linenr"> 2:  </span>  attr_accessor :pid
<span class="linenr"> 3:  </span>  attr_accessor :stat
<span class="linenr"> 4:  </span>  attr_accessor :time
<span class="linenr"> 5:  </span>  attr_accessor :elapsed_time
<span class="linenr"> 6:  </span>  attr_accessor :virtual_size
<span class="linenr"> 7:  </span>  attr_accessor :rss
<span class="linenr"> 8:  </span>  attr_accessor :percent_cpu
<span class="linenr"> 9:  </span>  attr_accessor :percent_mem
<span class="linenr">10:  </span>  attr_accessor :command
<span class="linenr">11:  </span>
<span class="linenr">12:  </span>  # Create the object
<span class="linenr">13:  </span>  def initialize(line_string)
<span class="linenr">14:  </span>    line = line_string.split(' ')
<span class="linenr">15:  </span>    @pid = line[0]
<span class="linenr">16:  </span>    @stat = line[1]
<span class="linenr">17:  </span>    @time = line[2]
<span class="linenr">18:  </span>    @elapsed_time = line[3]
<span class="linenr">19:  </span>    @virtual_size = line[4]
<span class="linenr">20:  </span>    @rss = line[5]
<span class="linenr">21:  </span>    @percent_cpu = line[6]
<span class="linenr">22:  </span>    @percent_mem = line[7]
<span class="linenr">23:  </span>    @command = line[8]
<span class="linenr">24:  </span>  end
<span class="linenr">25:  </span>end
</pre>


<p>
I know it isn&#8217;t much but I still learned writing it. For example, when I was tinkering with the org-ruby gem, I just copied and pasted code, looked up some details in the Ruby library, etc&hellip; Being that I was modifying existing code, I never learned even the basic syntax. 
</p>
<p>
For example, in order to write my <code>PSDataLine</code> class, I needed to learn how Ruby uses syntax to determine if an identifier is a local variable, an instance variable, a global variable, or a constant. (My thanks to the <a href="http://bit.ly/JBzTER">Rubyist</a> for the good reference.)
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m pretty busy this week so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll make much progress on it. I was only able to get this work done by staying up till midnight on a Friday night and squeezing in time for a proofreading today.
