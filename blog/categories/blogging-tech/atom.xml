<h2 id="sec-2">File Distribution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>In my mind, file backup and file distribution across multiple machines are intimately related. File backup is, well it's file backup. I use file distribution to keep various files synchronized across my devices. It should be noted that while the goal of file distribution is synchronization of data across computers, distributing files to other computers effectively backs them up.
</p>
<p>
My primary computers are my MacBook Pro and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard">HP</a> laptop running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)">Ubuntu Linux</a>. My mobile is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Infuse_4G">Samsung Infuse</a> running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod#CyanogenMod_10">CyanogenMod 10</a>, a customized version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_4.1.x_Jelly_Bean">Android 4.1 Jelly Bean</a>. I also rent a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computer</a> running Ubuntu. Lastly, I have an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus">Asus</a> running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">Windows 7</a>. I primarily use te Windows computer for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media">streaming media</a> (I don't dig Windows).
</p>
<p>
I use file distribution to achieve two goals. I like to keep my configuration files consistent across my MacBook and two Ubuntu computers. This includes my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)#Startup_scripts">.bashrc</a> and my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp#Source_code">.emacs</a> site startup files. While I want those files to stay in sync to make the management of them simpler, there's generally no rush in synchronizing them. 
</p>
<p>
Another example of my file distribution involves my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_manager">PIM</a>. I use <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> as my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_manager">PIM</a> and want the data files to be synchronized across my MacBook, two Linux boxes, and my Android. I want those files synchronized immediately as I frequently move from computer to computer and always want my PIM data to be up to date.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Prioritization Of File Backup And File Distribution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>My backup and distribution strategy categorizes files using two metrics:
</p><dl>
<dt>File Importance</dt><dd>This describes how critical each file is. Files in <code>~/Downloads</code> are typically not very important while the text for this blog entry is very important (at least to me).
</dd>
<dt>Synchronization Delay</dt><dd>As I move between multiple computers, my productivity is related to how frequently some files are synchronized across the computers. Some I want optimized as soon as possible while other files can take hours or even days to get synchronized without affecting my productivity. Some low priority files, such as those in <code>~/Downloads</code> don't ever need to be synchronized across machines.
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
In practice this leads to four types of files:
</p><dl>
<dt>High/Timely</dt><dd>Files that are very important and need to be synchronized in a timely fashion. My PIM files fall into this category.
</dd>
<dt>High/Delayed</dt><dd>Important files that don't need to timely synchronization. Configuration files such as my .bashrc are High/Delayed.
</dd>
<dt>Low/Delayed</dt><dd>Files that are convenient to have across my machines but aren't essential to my immediate productivity. For example, I frequently download manuals for various appliances that I own. I like to have them handy but it's fine if they aren't synched immediately. As I can easily download them again, they're of relatively low importance.
</dd>
<dt>Everything else</dt><dd>These are files that are of significantly low importance that I don't worry too much about them.
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
My backup and distribution strategy varies by which quadrant (I'm excluding the N/A boxes) a file is in.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">There's Data That Should Be Backed Up That Is Not In A File</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>My first lesson was that not all data is backupable via file backup and distribution processes. The best example I have of this is the set of installed applications. Applications are typically large files and frequently require complex installations. While many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_os_x">Mac OS X</a> applications can be installed by copying the file into the <code>/Applications</code> directory, others require the use of package installers. This is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> applications that store data in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_registry">Windows Registry</a>.
</p>
<p>
Knowing that applications were cumbersome and frequently needed special installation scripts led me to decide to not back up my applications. After this disk crash, I continue to think that it makes no sense to backup your installed apps. That said, I have sorely missed having a list of the applications that I had installed before the disk problems.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Monitor Installed Applications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>My initial response to the lack of a list of installed apps was to start recording apps as I installed them. After the first half-dozen or so apps I decided that this was a bad idea. I could see that the list was going to be incomplete, outdated, and generally not very helpful.
</p>
<p>
So I took a few minutes to whip up a trivial shell script that I run once a day via crontab. The shell script attempts to record the names of installed applications rather than the actual applications themselves. The version of the shell script that I'm currently using is:
</p>


<pre class="src src-sh-mode">#!/bin/sh
shopt -s nullglob
shopt -u failglob
ls -dlrt /Applications/* /Library/PreferencePanes/* ~/Library/PreferencePanes/* &gt; ~/Dropbox/Backups/InstalledApps.txt
</pre>


<p>
An abbreviated sample of its output is:
</p>


<pre class="example">drwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel  102 May  5  2009 /Applications/Font Book.app
drwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel  102 May 19  2009 /Applications/Stickies.app

drwxr-xr-x   3 neil  staff  102 Aug 18 11:52 /Applications/GrowlSafari.app
</pre>


<p>
As this script is run once a day and stored in my Dropbox folder, I always have an up-to-date copy of the file.
</p>
<p>
I still have some changes planned for the script:
</p><ul>
<li>The script only works for typical Mac OS X applications. It doesn't check for command line applications as well as applications installed by a package manager such os <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> (Mac OS X package installer), <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> (Perl package installer), or <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/">rbenv</a> (Ruby package installer - sort of).
</li>
<li>Perhaps I had a good reason to put the data file into my Dropbox folder but I can't recall it now. This data seems a perfect example of High/Delayed data as discussed in the table above.
</li>
<li>The script misses some peculiar applications. Most of these applications are from Apple. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> is a good example of a "peculiar" application. Xcode includes a GUI application, command line programs, and runtime libraries. These get scattered across the machine. I suspect I'll just hardcode these applications into my script rather than trying to create the logic to find them. For example, I'll have my script add a line to the installed applications that reads <code>Xcode from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/</code>. That seems good enough.
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Other Missing Data</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">

<p>Missing the list of installed apps had a quick fix but other data isn't so readily available or I don't know how to access it. Some examples of missing data are:
</p><ul>
<li>Customized icons for folders: On Mac OS X you can associate a small icon to each folder. On the directories that I use routinely I have customized the icons so that I can find them quickly.
</li>
<li>The settings of some Chrome extensions did not get restored.
</li>
<li>My cron jobs were only stored within cron's database.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The cron jobs problem was another one that I was able to fix with a simple shell script and a minor modification to my workflow. Instead of editing my cron jobs directly via <code>crontab -e</code>, I now keep them in a file in my <code>bin</code> directory and modify that file as needed. When I modify my cron jobs I can either run crontab to immediately update my cron jobs or wait until I run my nightly cron job as that auto-updates my cron jobs:
</p>



<pre class="src src-sh-mode">#!/bin/sh

# Run my apps lister
$HOME/bin/installed-apps-lister.sh

# Run other stuff that I've removed from this example.

# Update my cron jobs in case I've modified the cron file.
crontab $HOME/bin/crontab-jobs
</pre>


<p>
The <code>$HOME/bin/crontab-jobs</code> file gets automatically backed up with the rest of my bin files.

<p>I've discussed the pros and cons about static blogging <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/blog/categories/blogging-tech/">many times</a> before. In summary, the cons are that, well that your blog is static. No surprise there.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are ways to push the limits of static blogging so that it is not quite so static.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Website Hosting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Unless you are self-hosting your <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog, you are using another site to host your blog. I host mine on Github. They have a web server running 24x7 to host it. But that's not my problem. I just use their (free) services.
</p>
<p>
I understand that website hosting isn't a terribly exciting example of stretching the bubble of static blogging, but it is an example nonetheless. Dynamic blogs require specialized software running on their hosting computer to work. Static blogs tend to be able to run on generic web servers but there still must be a web server or there's no blog.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">JavaScript Helps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Out of the box, Octopress comes with some features to show your most recent tweets as well as recent activity within your <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> repositories. This is dynamic data that Octopress implements with some JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Just to be clear, by <i>dynamic data</i> I mean that the data displayed on the page may change without a republication of the blog. I am not necessarily referring to a scrolling widget or something. Just dynamic data. 
</p>
<p>
Conversely, JavaScript can be used to dynamically display static data. That is, data that is embedded in the source of the web page. Being that the data is embedded in the page's source at or before publication time, it is assuredly <i>static data</i>.
</p>
<p>
But client-side JavaScript (ie: JavaScript running in the user's browser) has its limits. For example, if you want to send a tweet whenever you add a new blog entry, client-side JavaScript is going to have a hard time at it.

<h2 id="sec-4">Pushing Beyond Web Hosting JavaScript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>The trick behind adding a much wider array of dynamic features to your <i>static</i> blog is:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Integrate with external web services and let them do the work for you.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
It is even better if you can let other sites do the hard work for you free of charge. For example, Github is hosting this blog at no cost to me. Thank you Github! But Github won't tweet about my new blog postings or search through my website. Fortunately, there are services that will happily do that for you.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Site Search</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">

<p>This blog's search functionality is provided by Google. Dynamic blogging systems such as <a href="http://joomla.org">Joomla</a> have a large array of <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/search-a-indexing">search extensions</a> that you can run on your server to provide various searching features. I'm sure that they provide a much larger set of functionality than my site's Google search provides. 
</p>
<p>
Richer functionality or not, each extension needs to be installed, configured, and maintained. With Octopress, you never need to think about your site's search functionality. The site comes preconfigured for Google site search. That works for me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Automated Tweeting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">

<p>There are many ways to tweet via an email message but there is no way, at least none that I've bothered to think through, to get Github to send emails formatted for a tweet whenever you post. But, there are many sites that will watch your blog for change and perform some activity when your blog changes.
</p>
<p>
Exactly which site you use depends on what your needs are. For automated tweeting I decided to use <a href="http://feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>. If you're unfamiliar with FeedBurner, it provides a web service that takes your site's RSS/Atom feed as input and adds value to that feed. My site's RSS feed is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyGeekdom">http://feeds.feedburner.com/MyGeekdom</a>. Assuming you don't have uncommon browser settings, if you visit that URL  you will see something that looks like: 
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.neilsmithline.com/assets/screen-snapshots/feedburner.png"  alt="http://www.neilsmithline.com/assets/screen-snapshots/feedburner.png" />
</p>
<p>
Amongst the multitude of options that FeedBurner provides is the ability to subscribe to a site by email. So I subscribed myself, using a unique email alias, to FeedBurner emails about updates to my site. I then created an email filter that automatically forwards the FeedBurner emails to my tweeting email address and <i>voila</i>, whenever I post a new article I automatically produce a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_smithline/status/227220890109218816">like this one</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Tracking "The Buzz"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">

<p>"The Buzz", also known as "Trending" or simply "current events", is a term to describe what is popular on the internet at any given moment. While tracking all of the internet's news doesn't seem appropriate for a blog, tracking news related to your blog posting may be desirable.
</p>
<p>
Courtesy of <a href="http://socialmention.com">SocialMention</a>, many of my blog postings have current news in the sidebar (see <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/blog/2012/07/15/bookifying-news/">example blog posting</a>). In many ways this is similar to tracking a Twitter #hashtag. But SocialMention gathers data from many dozens of web sites providing a richer and more diverse collection of data than Twitter can. 
</p>
<p>
For example, by tracking several popular bookmarking sites such as <a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a>, SocialMention can tell you what pages people are bookmarking that are related to your blog posting. Most people, thankfully, don't send a tweet whenever they bookmark a site.
</p>
<p>
While it may be redundant to state,
</p><blockquote>

<p>Displaying current events on your blog postings means that they will always have current information.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This means that there's no need to update your blog posting with links to relevant websites as new information becomes available. That is clearly a task that would become unmanageable as your blog grows. Instead, your <i>static blog</i> will always have <i>dynamic data</i> on it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">The Age Of Cloud Computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>While my blog is far from a large operation, the advent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> has made these dynamic features possible. From tiny systems like my blog to large systems like Google's search engine, cloud computing is about wiring together the most appropriate services in a manner that produces your desired functionality with a minimal amount of setup, cost, and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
While I don't have exact dates, my automated tweeting on new blog posts has been working maintenance free long enough that I forgot that I had implemented it until I noticed that I had just tweeted about my previous blog posting. I believe that is the very definition of "minimal maintenance".
</p>
<p>
Given the large and growing number of web services in the cloud and my limited time to explore them, I'm sure that this is but a small sampling of the different ways to use dynamic data in static blogs.

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>After yesterday's <a href="{{ root_url }}/blog/2012/05/26/octopress-is-pretty-great" title="Posting about Octopress">ranting about Octopress</a>, it occurred to me that while I now own the content of my blog postings, I don't own the content of my <a href="http://bit.ly/JvoqLE">tweets</a>. I'm sure that there's some way to convince <a href="http://bit.ly/Jvotaj">Twitter</a> to give me my tweets, but why should I rely on them to store my tweets.
</p>
<p>
The obvious answer is that my tweets should be created on my computer and then sent to Twitter. 
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that I'm not interested in implementing a full Twitter client. There are more than enough of those. I'm interested in having my tweets, or at least the bulk of my tweets, in a simple and easily accessible format.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The Answer Must Be Cheap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>While I want to author and store my tweets locally, it is not a high priority task for me. Whatever solution I come up with must add little or no overhead to my tweeting workflow, must be simple to implement, and cannot require ongoing tinkering to keep working.
</p>
<p>
Being that my relationship with <a href="http://bit.ly/zhYdcB">Org Mode</a> is rather simple: The more I learn about it the more of my life I want to be based on Org Mode. Org Mode just seems to make everything easier. So I decided to use Org Mode for the author, publication, and storage of my tweets. The system I'm describing has these properties:
</p><ul>
<li>It took me just a few hours to design, implement, test, and begin using it for tweeting.
</li>
<li>Besides not adding overhead to my tweeting, it has made tweeting dramatically simpler.
</li>
<li>The entire implementation is a single file of <a href="http://bit.ly/wTaGtn">elisp</a> that is 120 lines long. 50 of those lines are standard Emacs header comments that are automatically created. The implementation, along with its documentation, is only 70 lines long. While a small code base isn't one of my goals, not needing ongoing tinkering is. It is hard to imagine that 70 lines of code will require too much tinkering.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Advantages Of Org Mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Before continuing, you should know a few facts about Org Mode:
</p><ul>
<li>At its core, Org Mode is an <a href="http://bit.ly/MSMf12">outliner</a> on steroids. This works great for me as I tend to organize my thoughts as trees. I'm obvious not alone as the <a href="http://bit.ly/MSMf12">outliner</a> page on <a href="http://bit.ly/KWo5OA">Wikipedia</a> has a list of many outliner applications along with <a href="http://bit.ly/KWoa4F">references</a> to many outliners that are designed to implement specific functionality. 
</li>
<li>Org Mode augments its outlining functionality with a <a href="http://bit.ly/MSKKjm">task management system</a> (<a href="http://bit.ly/MSKKjm">details</a>).
</li>
<li>Org Mode has a <a href="http://bit.ly/MSNhKm">template</a> based <a href="http://bit.ly/MSN7CO">data capturing</a> system that allows for the easy capturing of data into a consistent format.
</li>
<li>Org Mode is implemented in <a href="http://bit.ly/MSNvkN">GNU Emacs</a>. Besides the fact that I spend nearly all of my non-browser computer time in Emacs, Emacs has a <a href="http://bit.ly/MSNVrv">rich extension mechanism</a>
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">The Storage Structure Of Tweets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>Each tweet would be an outline entry whose title would be a small description of the tweet plus some other information to be discussed later. The body for each outline entry would be the tweet. In Org Mode this would look like:
</p><pre class="example">
* My First Tweet
  This is my first tweet using Org Mode.
</pre>


<p>
While this works fine for one tweet, after 50 or 100 tweets, things are going to get pretty messy. But, as Org Mode is an outliner, it supports the nesting of outline entries via both direct data entry as well as through Org Mode's capturing mechanism. You just need to provide Org Mode with a string that describes the data you want to capture and the outline format for that data.
</p>
<p>
While, for the moment, sparing you the ugliness of the capture configuration string, I'll tell you that Org Mode supports a date tree outline format.
</p><pre class="example">
* 2012
*** 2012-05 May
***** 2012-05-26 Saturday
******* My First Tweet
        This is my first tweet using Org Mode!
***** 2012-05-27 Sunday
******* My Second Tweet
        This is now my 2nd tweet using Org Mode!
</pre>


<p>
Being an outliner, Org Mode supports the <a href="http://bit.ly/KWoekU">folding</a> of the outline. That is, you can collapse the outline to hide parts of it that you are not immediately interested in. For example, let's say that, being today is Monday, I don't want to be bothered looking at my tweets from Saturday Or Sunday. No problem. When you fold the outline headings for Saturday and Sunday, the list of tweets will look like this:
</p><pre class="example">
* 2012
*** 2012-05 May
***** 2012-05-26 Saturday ...
***** 2012-05-27 Sunday ...
</pre>


<p>
The "&hellip;" is Org Mode's way to let you know that this entry has been folded.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that I get all of this storage mechanism from Org Mode for free. All I needed to do was create a single configuration string for it.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Capturing Tweets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>A simple yet highly functional storage mechanism is fine but what I'm looking for is to reduce my tweeting overhead. This means that the workflow is what I care about. 
</p>
<p>
The first part of the workflow is the "capturing" of my tweets. Org Mode's capturing mechanism is rather rich. It allows me to capture data (ie: to tweet) from Emacs with a couple of keystrokes. It also allows me to capture data, including an URL and highlighted text from my browser by clicking on a bookmarklet.
</p>
<p>
When I initiate a tweet capture, I'm initially prompted for a "title". That is the descriptive text for the tweet. In the above example, "My First Tweet" is a title. After entering my title, I'm given an <a href="http://bit.ly/KWpdBF">Emacs buffer</a>, basically a new Emacs window, in which to type my tweet.
</p>
<p>
When I'm done typing my tweet, a couple of keystrokes tells Org Mode that it should add the tweet to my tweet file and save the file. 
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Tweeting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>Now that I've captured my tweet, I need to actually tweet it. This is where some of the wonders of Emacs come into play. Emacs has lots of <a href="http://bit.ly/KWpRPv">hooks</a> that allow you to insert code into the workflow. Org Mode adds many hooks of its own.
</p>
<p>
Without boring you with the exact details, by using the appropriate hooks I have set up Emacs to take special actions whenever a file is saved that ends in "-update.org". I used the file naming convention of "-update" instead of "-tweet" in case I decide to add other types of status messages at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Being as I was going for simple, I decided that Emacs would not talk directly to Twitter. Instead, I have Emacs use the wonderfully intuitive, functional, and efficient <a href="http://bit.ly/KGlf2s">t application</a>. For my purposes, <code>t</code>'s <a href="http://bit.ly/xOIkfJ">CLI</a> is perfect. Once you've signed into Twitter with <code>t</code>, it will tweet for you with the simple command line of:
</p><pre class="example">
t update This is my tweet text.
</pre>


<p>
That seems about as simple as it can get.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">Tracking Tweet Status</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">

<p>Being that I'm storing more than one tweet in a file, it is important that I know which tweets have been tweeted and which ones haven't. This is another place where I get to leverage the wonders of Org Mode.
</p>
<p>
Beyond outlining, Org Mode supports a simple yet highly functional and customizable <a href="http://bit.ly/KWrJrE">task management system</a>. The customizability allows you to define task states well beyond the typical "open" and "closed" states of many other task managers. 
</p>
<p>
I used the task management to teach Org Mode about status update tasks. A status update task can be in one of two states: <code>POST</code> and <code>DONE</code>. When it is in the <code>POST</code> state, it needs to be posted. The <code>DONE</code> state means it has already been posted. Org Mode's slogan is 
</p><pre class="example">
Org: Your Life in Plain Text
</pre>

<p>and they mean it.
</p>
<p>
To indicate a tweet's, ie: a task's, state, you simply add the state to the outline header line. For example, using the example from above, if I had already posted my first tweet but not my second, the outline would look like this:
</p><pre class="example">
* 2012
*** 2012-05 May
***** 2012-05-26 Saturday
******* =DONE= My First Tweet
        This is my first tweet using Org Mode!
***** 2012-05-27 Sunday
******* =POST= My Second Tweet
        This is now my 2nd tweet using Org Mode!
</pre>


<p>
When I use Org Mode's capturing mechanism to add my new tweet to the file, it automatically adds the state of <code>POST</code> to each new tweet. As mentioned above, when the tweet file is saved it executes my code. While I have 70 lines of code, only two functions consisting of a total of 45 lines is needed to post my tweets. The remaining 35 lines are configuration that, via Emacs and Org Mode's hooks, makes sure that my code is called whenever the tweet file is saved. 
</p>
<p>
The first function, all 9 lines of it, simply asks Org Mode to loop through all tweets (ie: outline headings) in the <code>POST</code> state and call my second function on each of those tweets. The second function calls the CLI t to execute the tweet. This 28 line function that actually does the tweeting is really rather simple. Only 10 lines of it are related to actually tweeting. The remainder of the function is error handling in case, for some reason, my tweet fails.
</p>
<p>
After successfully tweeting a status update, I tell Org Mode to change the tweet's state from <code>POST</code> to <code>DONE</code>. That's all there is to it.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Some Nice Freebies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">

<p>Besides the data capturing, the ease of calling an external program, the automatic outline maintenance, the automatic state tracking (ie: <code>POST</code> and <code>DONE</code>), and the automatic execution of my tweeting code whenever the tweet file is saved, the Emacs and Org Mode's richness provide other nice features:
</p><ul>
<li>Twitter's 140 character limit per tweet is easily eyeballed while you are typing in Emacs as the editor tells you how long a line is. I have, of course, implemented a character count error check before tweeting, but it is nice to catch the problem when you are typing. 
</li>
<li>Automated highlighting of tweets.
</li>
<li>A common problem with the 140 character limit on tweets is that URLs can be very long. Emacs helps here with its <a href="http://bit.ly/wSSiWH">Bitly library</a> (courtesy of me :-). This shortens URLs in Emacs, using Bitly, with two keystrokes. (Bitly happens to be my current URL shortener of choice.)
</li>
<li>Org Mode has the ability to automatically record a variety of times associated with each task. I have set up Org Mode to record the time the tweet was entered by me as well as the time that it actually got tweeted.
</li>
<li>Org Mode allows you to <a href="http://bit.ly/KWtipB">tag</a> (aka: "label" or "categorize") each outline item. I have leveraged this in anticipation of extending the tweeting system to include status updates to other services than Twitter. Also, in the future I may want to be able to manage multiple Twitter accounts. I'm not sure that I'll ever implement that functionality, but thought I'd throw it in as preparing for it is essentially free. I currently label each status update with two labels. The first label describes the type of status update. In this case it is "TWEET" to designate that I want to update Twitter. The second label is "NS" to indicate that I want to update the status of my <a href="http://bit.ly/KWtyVp">@neil_smithline</a> Twitter account.
</li>
<li>Emacs is my tweet editor. For those of you who don't know Emacs as well as those of you that know Emacs and hate it, I'm sure you wouldn't want to edit tweets in Emacs. But I have been using Emacs for 25+ years and still think it is pretty slick. Besides the functionality discussed above, Emacs gives me <a href="http://bit.ly/KWtPb0">spell checking/correction</a>, the ability to easily change the case of something I've mistyped, functionality based on English grammar (eg: the ability to move, delete, or even transpose words or sentences), etc&hellip;
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">A Sneak Peek</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">

<p>After all my blathering, I thought that a screenshot of my tweets would be nice. This screenshot shows tweets for the past three days. I have folded the tweets from Saturday so that they are easy to ignore. For the sake of this picture, I have unfolded my tweets from Sunday so that it shows what a posted tweet looks like. Finally, I have a tweet for today that is queued up to announce this blog posting. 
</p>
<p>
As you look at this screenshot, remember that almost all of this is automatically generated. For example, for the final tweet I had to enter the title "Tweeting From Emacs" (this can actually be blank but I think the title makes it more useful) and the actual tweet. Everything else, including the Bitly URL shortening, comes for free.

<h2 id="sec-1">Jekyll Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I have simply fallen in love with <a href="http://bit.ly/KT1aFT">Octopress</a>. I think I mentioned previously that Octopress is an auto-configuration tool wrapped around <a href="http://bit.ly/Jm1bmc">Jekyll</a>. And Jekyll is the technology behind <a href="http://bit.ly/Krch8n">Github pages</a>. As such, if you use Jekyll for your blogging platform, you can preview your blog locally, push it to Github, and let Github do all the page serving. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't actually as much work for the Github servers as you may think. Jekyll is a <a href="http://bit.ly/KrdOeu">static</a> <a href="http://bit.ly/KrdUmf">blogging system</a> with no <a href="http://bit.ly/KrdX1s">CMS support</a>. A static blog needs to be <a href="http://bit.ly/Kre8tB">compiled</a> whenever content is modified, but once compiled, the only thing the server needs to do is serve the pages. Dynamic blogging systems such as <a href="http://bit.ly/KreoZJ">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/KreuAH">Joomla</a> are programs that run on the server and work interactively with the web server to produce each page.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Octopress's biggest addition to Jekyll is that it automagically configures Jekyll for you. I have found that configuring Jekyll is a bit of a pain. Jekyll decided to trade easy configuration for flexibility. This is a common decision in applications and one I can't really argue with.
<!-- more -->

But Octopress packages a mostly configured Jekyll installation in a neat little package. The introductory paragraph on <a href="http://bit.ly/KT1aFT">Octopress.org</a> states:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and you're set.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
While that may sound a bit intimidating to the less-computer literate, the Octopress site carefully steps you through the process. I've installed and used Wordpress, Joomla, <a href="http://bit.ly/KrgcC1">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/wq2Ien">Nanoblogger</a>, and many other blogging systems. I can say that Octopress is, by far, the easiest. 
</p>
<p>
The above quote states three steps for installing Octopress but there are actually a few more steps:
</p><ol>
<li>Install Git
</li>
<li>Clone or fork Octopress
</li>
<li>Install dependencies
</li>
<li>Install theme
</li>
<li>Configure your blog
</li>
<li>Configure deployment
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Git</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<p>If you don't have <a href="http://bit.ly/KrgU2a">Git</a> installed, you need to install it. This was a trivial task for most users but, thanks to the clever folk at Github, has become idiot-proof. Github created a <a href="http://bit.ly/KrhqgF">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Windows</a> application that allows easy use of Github. These make installing and using Git user-friendly for those who prefer to avoid <a href="http://bit.ly/xOIkfJ">CLI</a>s.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Clone Or Fork Octopress</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">

<p>Cloning Octopress, simpler than forking it, is a single command line 
</p><pre class="example">
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
</pre>

<p>It takes only a few mouse clicks if you are using one of Github's applications to do the clone. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Install Dependencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">

<p>Installing the dependencies is, yet again, a few simple CLI commands described in an easy-to-read style on Octopress's <a href="http://bit.ly/LExpsY">setup</a> page.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Install The Theme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">

<p>Installing the theme is a single CLI command:
</p><pre class="example">
rake install
</pre>

<p>There are additional theme installation options but you can simply ignore them as the defaults work well. In a subsequent blog post I'll discuss how I have made a minor alteration to the Octopress installation that allows me to entirely change my theme as often as I like without losing any data. Simple theme changes (eg: page colors) are easy to make at anytime. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Configure Your Blog</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">

<p>Configuring your blog is perhaps the most complicated step in the entire installation process. You'll need to open a text editor such as <a href="http://bit.ly/LEyD7l">Textedit</a> on a Mac or <a href="http://bit.ly/LEyRvo">Notepad</a> on Windows. 
</p>
<p>
The configuration file is written in a format called <a href="http://bit.ly/LEzjd3">YAML</a>. That sounds a lot scarier than it actually is. Octopress's <a href="http://bit.ly/Mlynfm">configuration page</a> states that you just need to edit the existing <code>_config.yml</code>, and modify the following lines:
</p><pre class="example">
url:                # For rewriting urls for RSS, etc
title:              # Used in the header and title tags
subtitle:           # A description used in the header
author:             # Your name, for RSS, Copyright, Metadata
simple_search:      # Search engine for simple site search
description:        # A default meta description for your site
subscribe_rss:      # Url for your blog's feed, defauts to /atom.xml
subscribe_email:    # Url to subscribe by email (service required)
email:              # Email address for the RSS feed if you want it.
</pre>


<p>
Several of the configuration options have default values or can be left empty.
</p>
<p>
This configuration step in Octopress differs from other blogging systems only in that you have to use Textedit or Notepad to enter the data. Many other systems allow you to enter the data into a <a href="http://bit.ly/n1i2v2">GUI</a> or a web page. 
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6">Configuring Deployment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">

<p>Configuring your deployment, the final setup action, involves telling Octopress what computer is going to <a href="http://bit.ly/LECz8n">host</a> your blog. While you can run your blog right on your desktop or laptop, it will only be visible by other people in your home or office. This is helpful if you want to preview your blog before "publishing" it so the rest of the world can see it but when you want to publish your blog you will need to have access to a hosting computer (AKA: a server) that is on the internet <a href="http://bit.ly/LEIgTI">24x7</a>.
</p>
<p>
Getting access to a server can be less than straightforward and almost always costs money. But this is rather simple with Octopress because:
</p><ul>
<li>Octopress is a static blog. This is compared to a dynamic blog that requires programs to interact with the server. Once Octopress has done its job, you just need to put the blog into the right location on your server and everything will magically work.
</li>
<li>Octopress, the blogging system that tries to make configuration easy, has carefully documented, in easy-to-read text, three different ways to <a href="http://bit.ly/LEGcuN">host your blog</a> on a server. Two of them are absolutely free: Github itself (the one I use) and <a href="http://bit.ly/LEGIsK">Heroku</a>. The third strategy using <a href="http://bit.ly/LEIdHt">rsync</a> is a bit more complex and typically costs some money to use. That being said, the documentation guides you to a hosting company that charges only $5 a month for server access. Unless you <b>know</b> that you need a server for something besides hosting a blog, I strongly recommend going with one of the other options. 
</li>
</ul>


<p>
As I said, I am using Github to host my blog. It takes exactly one line to configure your blog to use Github. I haven't used the other deployment mechanisms but Heroku seems to be of equal complexity while rsync definitely requires more work and a greater knowledge of computers.

<div id="outline-container-2-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-7">Configuration Summary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">

<p>While there is a lot of descriptive text above, the entire configuration process took me a couple of hours the first time and about 20 minutes the second time. Unless you are like me and enjoy trying stupid things, you'll only need to install it once :-) I would imagine that a non-technical users could easily install Octopress in half a day.
</p>
<p>
The only exception that I can think of would be if you're on a Windows computer and have lots of difficulties installing the dependencies. Mac OSX and Linux come with most of the dependencies pre-installed. I don't think that Windows does.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">It's Blogging Time!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Before you can actually start to blog, you need to choose an editor and a markup language. While you can change these at anytime, you need one of each to blog. I'll discuss this in a subsequent blog posting where I discuss my personal Octopress configuration.
</p>
<p>
Now that everything is configured, it's time to blog. While this involves using the command line, it is a trivial usage. When you want to create a new post you execute the command:
</p><pre class="example">
rake 'new_post[Name Of My Post]'
</pre>

<p>The reason why that is the magical incantation to create a new post is unimportant. All you need to do is remember (or be able to lookup) that command.
</p>
<p>
When the <code>rake</code> command finishes, it will tell you the name of the file for your new posting. Just open the file and start typing. If you want to see a preview of your blog before publishing it to the server, run the command
</p><pre class="example">
rake preview
</pre>


<p>
Then you can open your web browser to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a> to see your blog. I strongly recommend that you copy-and-paste that URL and then bookmark it. 
</p>
<p>
Once you are ready to publish your blog to the world, execute the command
</p><pre class="example">
rake gen_deploy
</pre>

<p>And <i>voila</i>! You have updated your blog.

<div id="outline-container-4-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-1">Configuration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">

<p>Configuring Octopress is definitely more complex than configuring a blog on Blogger.com or a similar service. If you are looking for the easiest solution, no-frills solution, go with one of those.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-2">Single Computer Publishing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">

<p>While I haven't seen it explicitly stated in any documentation for Octopress or Jekyll, they really are intended to publish new posts from a single computer. You can author the posts on any computer or network service. The first option that jumps into my head is <a href="http://bit.ly/KTgaWb">Google Docs</a>. But to publish (ie: to deploy) your site from more than one computer will definitely require extra configuration, computer skills, and tinkering. If you absolutely must <i>publish</i> from multiple computers, the online blogging systems may be a better choice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Pros</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">


</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-2-1">Configuration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-1">

<p>While configuring a blog on a site like Blogger is definitely easier than configuring Octopress, if Blogger doesn't meet your needs, I think Octopress is easier to manage than all Joomla, Drupal, and all of its competitors &ndash; at least the ones I've seen.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-2-2">Content Possession</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-2">

<p>When you use a site like Blogger.com, the content you have posted is in the possession of Blogger. They determine how they will store your content, how they will let you export it, modify it, delete it, etc&hellip; But with Octopress, you are always in possession of your content. In order to have your blog visible on the web, you must deploy it to a server, but that is just a copy of your content. You are always in possession of the original content.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-2-3">Content Accessibility</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-3">

<p>Whether you are using an online blogging service such as Blogger.com or hosting your own blogging application such as Joomla or Drupal, your postings are typically not stored in a convenient manner. Even if the blogging system lets you get access to all of your content, the content is frequently meaningless or difficult to use.
</p>
<p>
But with Octopress, the content for each posting is in a file. One file for each posting. While I've not discussed choosing an editor or a markup language in this posting, it is your choice of editor and markup language that determine what you can do with your content.
</p>
<p>
For example, I was blogging with Nanoblogger for a few months. As it required continual tinkering, I moved to Octopress. Like Octopress, Nanoblogger lets you choose your editor and markup language. Because both blogging systems give you accessibility to your content, I was able to convert about 20 Nanoblogger postings into Octopress postings in about 20 minutes. I imagine it would have taken less computer-savvy users as long as 2-3 minutes a posting. 
</p>
<p>
The one-file-one-posting principal of Octopress, and Nanoblogger, make life so much simpler.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-2-4">And It Looks Good Too!</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-4">

<p>Even after customizing them, I find that Wordpress blogs tend to be drap and all look like <a href="http://bit.ly/KThoAU">this</a> and that Blogger.com blogs require lots of tinkering but still tend to look like <a href="http://bit.ly/KThtVf">this</a>. On the other hand, Octopress blogs tend to look like the <a href="http://bit.ly/KT1aFT">Octopress homepage</a> or my <a href="http://bit.ly/yGGszW">blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
IMO, Octopress looks great out of the box. I am partial to using dark themes where black, white, and shades of gray are the main colors. It took me about 10 minutes to change the default <a href="http://bit.ly/KT1aFT">colors for Octopress</a> to use my preferred <a href="http://bit.ly/yGGszW">color pallette</a>.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-2-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-2-5">It Will Grow With You</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-5">

<p>I think that Octopress's greatest features are the above mentioned ease-of-configuration and the fact that, while it is hidden from you, it is built on a very strong blogging engine, Jekyll. So, if you wake up one day and say "Gee. I wish my blog could do XYZ.", the odds are that it can. Just google "Jekyll blogs XYZ" and, at least for reasonable XYZs, you'll find that instructions about reconfiguring your blog so it can do XYZ.
</p>
<p>
There are also many discussion groups, forums, and helpful Jekyll users in the blogosphere that can offer suggestions, provide pointers, or even make a small modification to Octopress/Jekyll so that XYZ is easy to do.

<h2 id="sec-5">Future Postings About Octopress</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>This is now my second posting about Octopress. My {{{relative_url(2012/05/14/new-blog-tech, First Posting, first posting)}}} discussed my initial opinions about Octopress. They were largely positive but so too were my {{{relative_url(/blog/2011/12/07/new-blog-tech, Nanoblogger Posting, initial impressions)}}} of Nanoblogger. 
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing this blog posting I'm certain that I'm going to love Octopress. (Though, if I change my mind, I am in possession of my own content so it is easy to switch to another platform.)
</p>
<p>
My next posting about Octopress will explain the minor modifications I have made to Octopress. I made these modifications to accomplish two goals:
</p><ol>
<li>Allow me to easily use <a href="http://bit.ly/zhYdcB">Org Mode</a> as my markup language and <a href="http://emacswiki.org">Emacs</a> as my editor. While I simply love this setup, I imagine that it will only be of interest to preexisting Emacs users.
</li>
<li>Keep my content totally separate from the Octopress's content. By this I mean that if, you were to burn my computer as I'm typing these very words, I could have Octopress up and running on a new computer with all of my content, including postings, images, etc.., in about 20 minutes. IMO, this an improvement on Octopress's configuration and should probably be changed in Octopress.
</li>
</ol>
