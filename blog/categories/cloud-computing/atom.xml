    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
Based on a LifeHacker posting, I previously blogged about giving SparkleShare a try.. It was cool. A free Dropbox with private hosting. So I installed, configured, and started using SparkleShare. While I was quite excited when I embarked upon my journey using SparkleShare, things didn't work out as well as I had hoped.
</p>


<p>
I quickly found out that SparkleShare doesn't handle symbolic links. Not at all. There's no workaround. The problem is that SparkleShare relies on Git for synchronization and Git doesn't support symbolic links. At least for me, this rendered SparkleShare useless. 
</p>


<p>
When I moved to Dropbox directory, what I had been using for synchronization before SparkleShare, had no files in it, just a bunch of symbolic links. But with SparkleShare, you have to move all your directories into your SparkleShare directory and then scatter symbolic links around your system where the you want the directories to be. This caused a variety of minor but really annoying problems.
</p>


<p>
But SparkleShare totally fails if you want to synchronize a directory that has symbolic links in it. SparkleShare's forum was covered with complaints about the symbolic link problem.
</p>


<p>
I am currently using the following scheme for file distribution/backups:
</p>


<ul>
<li>I'm using rsync to keep my media, bin directory, dot-files, and the like in sync on all my computers.
</li>
<li>For actual backups, I've been using Crashplan for years and couldn't be happier.
</li>
<li>And, in the past week or two, I've put Dropbox synchronization back into the mix to manage synchronization between Org Mode files on my computers and MobileOrg files on my Android. Despite the strong cult following that Dropbox has, synching with my mobile seems to be the only effective use I can find for it. 
</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2012-02-29T11:42:35-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://Neil-Smithline.github.com/blog/2012/02/29/azure-sunny-day</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
According to <a href="http://bit.ly/zc1OOr">The Register</a> (via <a href="http://bit.ly/wzufGC">Slashdot</a>), Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, has been down, and I mean <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/kaput">kaput</a>, for 8+ hours. Worse yet, Azure's status page that tells its customers about outages and expected repair times, to which I won't provide a link, has now been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdotted">Slashdotted</a> and is down.
</p>


<p>
Less than a year ago, <a href="http://bit.ly/Ay7loE">AWS</a> suffered a significant, though less serious, <a href="http://bit.ly/yNzqJy">outage</a>.
</p>


<p>
While highly-distributed, cloud-based computing is clearly the future of IT, how can an organization understand the costs and prepare for the unavoidable outages? With the relative newness of 3^rd party cloud services, what statistics are useful.
<!-- more -->

For example, let's consider a fictitious service cloud service Neil's Cloud Computing or NCC. NCC is a more established cloud computing service. Its detailed records shows that it has been open for 1,701 days (approximately 4.7 years). In that time it has steadily grown to here it now runs tens of millions of instances of virtual computers, services tens of billions requests each day, and has never had a serious outage. 
</p>


<p>
To be generous, let's define a <i>serious outage</i> as any outage that renders key parts of the site unusable to a significant portion of the site's users and lasts a minimum of five minutes. We'll consider any outage less than that a <i>tolerable outage</i>. 
</p>


<p>
Even with all of this information, how can you calculate the cost of moving your enterprise to a cloud computing platform in general or NCC's in specific (let's assume that NCC is the best service you can find - after all, it is named after me). Even if your is willing to ignore all costs associated with the generously named <i>tolerable outages</i>, how can you know NCC's 1,701 days of uptime mean that it will have another 4.7 years of uptime? How can you know it will be up tomorrow?
</p>


<p>
The answer is simple: You can't! Just as it says on the bottom of financial documents, past performance is no guarantee of future results.
</p>


<p>
But, when it comes to managing an enterprise, "can't" means things like "can't go faster than the speed of light". Everything else is just "How much?". How much does our current IT solution cost? How much would a cloud computing solution cost? How much do our current outages cost us? What are the odds of having a <i>serious outage</i> if we moved to the cloud and how much would that cost us? Etc&hellip;

    <link href="http://Neil-Smithline.github.com/blog/2011/12/15/sparkleshare/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-15T10:04:43-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://Neil-Smithline.github.com/blog/2011/12/15/sparkleshare</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> 
<a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> took the internet by storm with its free storage and ease of
access. But Dropbox comes with a limited amount of data, a level of
secureness that is hard-to-understand, and rather proprietary.
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://sparkleshare.org">Sparkleshare</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">open source</a> alternative to Dropbox that hit my
radar screen about 6 months ago. I played with it a bit back then but
it didn't seem to be quite there. I think I was using an early-alpha,
pre-release version so I this was to be expected.
<!-- more -->

I gave it another try earlier this week and seem to be pretty happy
with it. Some of the things I like about it include:
</p>


<ol>
<li>I get to host it on my own server. This means the data is
     private. I own it. Nobody else has a copy of it. Etc.
</li>
<li>I have been renting a Linux <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> from <a href="http://rosehosting.com">RoseHosting.com</a> ($20/month)
     for many years so they provide me with a convenient, managed, and
     relatively secure place to host Sparkleshare.
</li>
<li>It only took me about 5 minutes to install and configure
     sparkleshare on my Linux VPS. Not because I'm brilliant but
     because Linux doesn't suck and Sparkleshare requires no special
     server software. Just a few standard packages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> and a
     copy-and-paste of one command line. The client install (Mac OS X)
     was equally simple.
</li>
<li>Being that it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_Open_Source_Software">FOSS</a>, there is continual scrutiny of the source
     code to maintain quality and security.
</li>
</ol>




<p>
The only real objection I have with it is that Dropbox allows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic links</a> in the Dropbox folder so I don't need to have all of my files in
one directory. I haven't yet gotten this to work on Sparkleshare.
Either I just haven't figured it out, someone else will add it
shortly, or, being it is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/Foss">FOSS</a>, I'll add it if I get motivated enough
(BTW: I'm voting for someone else implementing it).
