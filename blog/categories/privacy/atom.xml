<h2 id="sec-1">The Good</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>There are good, or at least, less bad ways of tracking users across websites. While I am shocked at writing this, <a href="http://bit.ly/LUUGHN">Google</a>'s <a href="http://bit.ly/NuCSSm">AdWords</a> service is an example of the good way to advertise. 
</p>
<p>
Google keeps track of every page that that Google users visit that has an ad served by Google's <a href="http://bit.ly/NuCSSm">lucrative advertising business</a>. To help you understand the magnitude of this, Google's advertising revenue is its primary source of revenue bringing in <a href="http://bit.ly/NuCSSm">$28 billion in 2010</a>.
</p>
<p>
The way it works is:
</p><ul>
<li>Sites want to make money selling ads. 
</li>
<li>The sites talk to Google about selling ads.
</li>
<li>Google gives the site the details about its AdWords advertising. These details include payment schedules, technical details about displaying ads, and the fact that Google will track users who view pages with Google ads on them.
</li>
<li>The site either agrees to this or it doesn't. If the site agrees, it will update its privacy policy if needed. If it doesn't agree, it shops around for other advertisers.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The entire process is open and well-documented. 
</p>
<p>
I frequently use <a href="http://bit.ly/NuEhs2">CNN</a> as a reference of a typical big-business, high-volume website. Being my <i>go to</i> site for big business, I decided to read their privacy policy. Note that I do not know if CNN uses AdWords or has any relationship with Google. I just used CNN's privacy policy as an example. CNN's privacy policy, conveniently located at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/privacy.html">http://www.cnn.com/privacy.html</a>, states:
</p><blockquote>

<p>We, our third party service providers, advertiser or our partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Perhaps that's not the most accessible language but it clearly communicates that you may be tracked by CNN, <a href="http://bit.ly/NuERGi">third party service providers</a>, or companies that advertise on CNN's website.

<h2 id="sec-3">The Ugly</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Recently, Facebook announced that it started to <a href="http://on.mash.to/L789wg">track users via Facebook Like buttons</a>. I am at a loss for words to describe how enraged this made me. It wasn't the fact that I was being tracked that bothered me. Like it or not, I know that I'm tracked. 
</p>
<p>
I also understand that Facebook frequently changes their privacy policy. I can keep up with those changes or not. My choice. But Facebook's decision to track users via their Like button is unlike any other privacy change I have ever heard of. 
</p>
<p>
For years Facebook has been telling websites about the benefits they get by incorporating a wide range of <a href="http://bit.ly/NuITyt">Facebook plugins</a>. The Facebook Like button <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1S19gtdJCXU/TjxsRjitE-I/AAAAAAAAAIw/OEpR4Le562I/s1600/Facebook-like-button.jpg"  alt="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1S19gtdJCXU/TjxsRjitE-I/AAAAAAAAAIw/OEpR4Le562I/s1600/Facebook-like-button.jpg" /> is simply ubiquitous across the web. Facebook's privacy change has turned every site that has a Like button on it into a data acquisition service for Facebook's ads. I believe the technical term for this is
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Bait And Switch
</p>
</blockquote>


</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">The Infection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>When I read about this change to Facebook's privacy policy I immediately recognized that it could potentially affect the privacy of any site with a Like button on it. I then decided to do three things in response to Facebook's decision to suddenly, and without warning, recruit millions of sites into providing data to enable Facebook to increase their advertising revenue:
</p><ol>
<li>I wrote <a href="http://bit.ly/M7Igbc">this blog posting</a>, describing what I thought about Facebook's new privacy policy and the way they handled the change.
</li>
<li>I created a Twitter account, <a href="http://bit.ly/NuKVi2">@fb_noprivacy</a>, just to share my anger via tweets.
</li>
<li>I started to look for sites that, through no fault of their own, were violating their own privacy policy because of Facebook started tracking users with the Like button.
</li>
</ol>

(<a href="http://bit.ly/NADZTP">Background information</a> about online advertising.)
</p>




<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Facebook Keeping Tabs On You</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p><a href="http://on.fb.me/L787EG">Facebook</a> has announced that it will sell user <a href="http://on.mash.to/L789wg">tracking information</a> to its
advertisers. Facebook, following in the steps of other large web <a href="http://bit.ly/NAEA84">advertising publishers</a> such as <a href="http://bit.ly/Kk80BT">Google</a>, claims that <a href="http://bit.ly/NAyR1R">targetted advertisements</a> are a <i>win-win</i> deal.
Advertisers win because they are able to provide ads that have a greater chance of
being <a href="http://bit.ly/L78I9p">clicked</a> and, hopefully, higher profit for the advertiser.
</p>
<p>
Users win because they see ads that they are more pertinent to their interests. For
example, a user who frequents technology websites may not have a strong interest in
an ad for laundry detergent. But that same user may appreciate ads about the newest
gadgets.
</p>
<p>
So, <i>win-win</i>! Everybody's happy.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Even I Can Count To Three</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
The phrase <i>win-win</i> implies that there are two involved parties. Facebook, Google, and other companies that track users for targeted ads seem to forget to mention that there are three involved parties:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The advertiser
</li>
<li>The user
</li>
<li>The publisher, that is the company selling the advertising
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Perhaps <i>win-win-win</i> is a more apropos statement than <i>win-win</i>.  The advertiser wins because their ads have a higher click-through rate, users win because they see ads that they are more interested in, and the publisher wins because they can charge a premium for targeted ads. For years Google has been running an instantaneous, automated <a href="http://bit.ly/NAzmZX">auction</a> so that Google gets the highest price possible for its ads.
</p>
<p>
A higher click-through rate is especially important for Facebook. Besides Facebook's <a href="http://engt.co/NAAf4x">new obligation</a> to its shareholders, Facebook has a notoriously low click-through rate. From a 2010 <a href="http://tcrn.ch/NAzZ5N">TechCrunch article</a>:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Biggest [advertising presence] doesn't mean most profitable. Facebook might be serving up more ads than almost anyone else, but they are still selling at very low ad rates because they perform poorly for the most part. If Facebook can figure out a way to make the ads on its site become more relevant and useful, it has a lot of room to boost its ad rates.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Facebook's Dilemma</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>While Facebook is forced to look for ways to increase their revenue via targeted
advertising, users tend to feel that having their internet usage being tracked is a
<a href="http://bit.ly/NAFtxi">privacy invasion</a>. As user tracking becomes more accurate, and hence more valuable to
Facebook and other advertising publishers, it is also viewed by users as a greater
invasion of privacy.
</p>
<p>
For years Facebook has been tracking users' activities as they roam the pages of Facebook. Facebook has also been gathering information about what non-Facebook pages users <a href="http://bit.ly/KIZZ8L">like</a>. These two types of tracking have a common property:
</p><blockquote>

<p>Facebook only tracks users when they interact with Facebook.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Whether the interaction is on the Facebook site or on another site where a user does a Facebook share or like.
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Facebook's Bait And Switch</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
The change in user tracking that Facebook announced is that they will track users even if they do not interact directly with Facebook. Facebook will now gather users' behavior whenever a user visits a site that has any Facebook code on it. That includes every page that has the ubiquitous:
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Facebook_like_thumb.png"  alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Facebook_like_thumb.png" /> 
button.
</p>
<p>
For years, Facebook has been facilitating websites to use its <i>Like</i> button as well as social widgets and other means of <a href="http://bit.ly/KJ4alc">Facebook integration</a> with your site. Facebook has discussed the <a href="http://bit.ly/KJ4Zdz">many benefits</a> this brings to website publishers.
</p>
<p>
Facebook's change in user tracking has many ramifications:
</p>
<ol>
<li>After years of facilitating Facebook integration with websites, Facebook has
     unilaterally decided to make every one of those sites a data collector for
     Facebook. 
</li>
<li>Once Facebook starts gathering this data, Websites with Facebook integration will be providing Facebook with valuable information without receiving any compensation for that information.
</li>
<li>Short of not using Facebook, users cannot effectively <a href="http://bit.ly/KJ7Inj">opting out</a> of this data tracking.
</li>
<li>Some sites will have to update their privacy policy to reflect Facebook's new data collection.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Furthermore, Facebook says that this change will happen within the <a href="http://bloom.bg/KJ6CI8">next few weeks</a>, leaving users and websites little time to react to the change. 
</p>
</div>

</div>




<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Alternates</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">

<p>Even if a website decided to make changes to their site, there are few options to the <i>Like</i> button that do not involve severing all Facebook integration. One solution would be to replace the <i>Like</i> button, along with badges from other sites, with a generic <a href="http://bit.ly/KJ91ma">social bookmarking widget</a>.
</p>
<p>
That said, only <a href="http://brightpinkstudio.com/pinkink/resources/social-bookmarking-widgets/3/">five of the top ten</a> social bookmarking widgets do not add tracking to their own widgets.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that Facebook, likely due to pressure from their recent IPO and their <a href="http://bit.ly/KJ9Ds6">plummeting stock price</a>, has decided to enlist, rather, <i>to draft</i> millions of sites into providing Facebook with valuable information at the cost of invading the users of those sites.
</p>
<p>
As this change in policy seems to leave Facebook as the only clear winner with users and other websites as losers, I think the phrase <i>win-lose-lose</i> is more appropriate Though probably not a good sales pitch.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"> <span class="timestamp">2012-06-14 Thu 12:39</span></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">

<p>Just saw that Facebook allowed its users to <a href="http://huff.to/JSfscI">vote</a> on the changes to its privacy policy. That said, comparing an old and a proposed privacy policy and understanding what the ramifications are is a very difficult task. Especially when there is little publicity about the voting process.
</p>
<p>
If if you heard about the voting, waded the through the privacy policy's legal jargon, understood how the change would affect you, and decided to vote, your vote wouldn't have counted.
</p>
<p>
Facebook said that they would consider any vote on their privacy policy as <i>advisory</i> unless a third of their 900M active users voted. The lack of publicity around the privacy policy change and  <a href="http://onforb.es/KYar2D">serious questions</a> about the veracity of Facebook's claim of 900M active users all but guaranteed that, whatever the votes were, they would be <i>advisory</i>.
