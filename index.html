<h2 id="sec-1">Motivation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to improve my time management skills. This is further discussed in this <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/time-tracking-experiments">Github README</a> file. I have also been keeping a <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/time-tracking-experiments/journal.html">journal</a> my activities and thoughts as I work on this project. You may also wish to read up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">Quantified Self</a>.

<h2 id="sec-2">Basic Activity Tracking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>While I I had not initially planned to focus on Mac OS X time tracking, it turned out to be easy. For a couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been playing around with two Mac OS X applications that track your computer activities: <a href="http://timingapp.com/">Timing</a> (actually <i>Timing Lite</i>) and <a href="http://manytricks.com/timesink/">Time Sink</a>.
</p>
<p>
Time Sink integrates with Mac OS X to track the <i>active</i> or <i>foreground</i> application and provides a variety of reports to display that information. In addition to tracking the current app, Time Sink tries to track what you were doing in that app. It achieves this by using a relatively low-tech process of collecting the active window&#8217;s name.
</p>
<p>
While a window name does not seem like a lot of information, it turns out to be surprisingly useful. From the window name Time Sink distinguishes, for example, the amount of time you spent browsing Facebook from the amount of time you spent browsing Github.
</p>
<p>
Time Sink can harvest this data from any app that includes information about the current activity. This includes editors that put the file being edited in the window name, media plays that put the title of what is currently being played, etc&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Your activities get displayed in a nice graphical format:
<img src="http://www.neilsmithline.com/assets/screen-snapshots/Time-Sink-Activities.png"  alt="http://www.neilsmithline.com/assets/screen-snapshots/Time-Sink-Activities.png" />
</p>
<p>
Due to browser page size I&#8217;ve excluded information such as how long I did these activities were as well as when I was doing them.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the activity tracking performed by Time Sink, Timing has some <a href="http://timingapp.com/faq.php#compatibility">application-specific</a> functionality that allows it to better track what you are doing inside an app.

<h2 id="sec-1">Bookifying News</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I frequently find it convenient to take a <i>website on the road</i>. That is, I want a website or part of a website in a convenient, portable, easily accessible format on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_Pad_Transformer">Asus Transformer</a> tablet. The Transformer has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11n">WiFi</a> but no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_services#Data_transmission">mobile data</a>. Without a portable means of accessing a website, the lack of data plan would dramatically limit the usability of my tablet.
</p>
<p>
I have taken to <i>bookifying</i> websites that I have an interest in staying up to date with (eg: <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>). For most sites, I only care about the newest postings. I convert the newest posting into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">epub</a> book, load it onto my tablet, and then read it using one an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebook_reader">ebook reader</a>.
</p>
<p>
Besides bookifying the newest articles on <a href="http://lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a>, I have also bookified entire websites.
</p>
<p>
The cool part is, this process requires a one-time configuration and then works automatically. That is, the entire web sites sit on my tablet and old website articles are automatically replaced by the new ones.

<h5 id="sec-1">De&#8217;fink&#8217;ing and Un&#8217;port&#8217;ing Mac OS X</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1">

<p>There are too many accursed package managers on Mac OS X. The big problem with this is that the best one is the newest so I&#8217;ve installed quite a bit with the older package managers: <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPort</a> and <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>. The best I can say about those package manners is that they frequently worked just fine. 
</p>

<p>
Then, out of the large pool of talented open-source Ruby engineers, <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation">homebrew</a> emerged.
</p>
<p>
Initially it was a bit short of packages but now it has a rich collection of packages. Adding new packages consists of just creating a mini Ruby script and putting it into the a Github repository (did I mention talented Ruby engineers?). 
</p>
<p>
Homebrew <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)">sandboxes</a> each package into a private directory. It then links the appropriate parts of the installed packages into the appropriate directories.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, MacPort and Fink are a bit hard on your computer. They install things all over your computer and don&#8217;t clean up after themselves. Homebrew recommends that you uninstall MacPort, Fink, and all of their packages to ensure a stable system.
</p>
<p>
Despite having stopped using MacPort and Fink months ago, I&#8217;ve left them installed. At least until yesterday.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, my Octopress/Jekyll blog broke stopped adding new posts. On average, eexperience has shown that it is best to assume I broke the problem and try to figure out how I broke it. After an hour or two of investigation I noticed that one of my <a href="http://rubygems.org">gems</a> was broken. I couldn&#8217;t figure out what was done to break it but I could try to fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
When I attacked the problem I found there was a dependency that had problems of its own. Progress was slow and painful. I was ecstatic when I got the gem working. But, alas, I immediately had a different gem giving me problems.
</p>
<p>
After a couple of times around the merry-go-round I decided that three were only a few options:
</p><ul>
<li>Remove MacPort and Fink and all of their packages as my build problems seemed associated with Homebrew&#8217;s interaction with them. Removing the packages is a bit awkward as they seem to install things in many places. Fortunately, when Homebrew tells you that it found a MacPort or Fink installation, it tells you the first thing that it found and what you can do to remedy the problem. After enough iterations of this, Homebrew finally stopped finding MacPort and Fink. I think it is a bit ironic that the cleanest way to remove MacPort or Fink is to use Homebrew as a guide.
</li>
<li>Reinstall Mac OS X and start with a fresh slate. Almost certainly a winning strategy but just as certainly a time-consuming procedure. The only reason I would even consider this option is because the last time I broke my OS by double-booting it with Ubuntu I created multiple disk partitions for Mac OS X to use. It uses one for my home directory, one for installed applications (ie: <code>/Applications</code>), and one for the OS. It is only the OS partition that I would need to erase. Still, it seems time-consuming.
</li>
<li>Throw my laptop out the window. This would clearly best meet my needs for instant gratification. As I&#8217;m typing this I&#8217;m visualizing whether the MacBook would smoothly glide through the air like a frisbee, tumble end-over-end, or just drop like a rock. Personally, the frisbee visualization is the one I find most attractive. That said, I have an incidental warranty from Best Buy and my computer is already in need of a repair (the class in front of my LCD is held on with packing tape). You could say this would kill two birds with one frisbee :-)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
At least for now, I&#8217;ve decided to remove MacPort, Fink, and all of their assorted packages and then reinstall everything with Homebrew. I believe that I have excised my machine of MacPort and Fink and am now using Homebrew to reinstall all of the packages that got deleted when I 86&#8217;ed MacPort and Fink.
</p>
<p>
Wish me luck&hellip;

If you install Python packages via "python3 setup.py install", easy_install3,
pip-3.2, any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above, so
you may want to add it to your PATH.

Distribute has been installed, so easy_install is available.
To update distribute itself outside of Homebrew:
