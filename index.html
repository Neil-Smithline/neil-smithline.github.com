<h2 id="sec-1">A Brief Introduction To Org Mode File Syntax</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I&#8217;ve decided that my time tracking solution requires some basic understanding of the file format of <a href="http://orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> as Org Mode syntax pervades the system. I&#8217;ve done my best to cover the smallest amount of Org Mode syntax that is needed to understand the examples I&#8217;ll of my time tracking system.
</p>
<p>
It is frequently said that when you buy a house the three most important things to look for are <a href="http://homebuying.about.com/od/marketfactstrends/qt/013008_location.htm">location, location, and location</a>. When it comes to Org Mode, the three most important things to remember are Org Mode file format is plain text, Org Mode file format is plain text, and Org Mode file format is plain text.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text">plain text</a> I mean:
</p><ul>
<li>You don&#8217;t need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> or any other program to read an Org Mode file.
</li>
<li>Any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text editor</a> can be used to create Org Mode files.
</li>
<li>Org Mode files are highly compatible with standard text file utilities such as <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/grep">grep(1)</a>.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
While Org Mode&#8217;s use of plain text has many advantages, the files tend to look a bit intimidating to a newcomer.
</p>
<p>
While this posting only discusses Org Mode&#8217;s file format, I use Org Mode for its incredibly rich organizational functionality.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Hierarchical Outlines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Org Mode encourages you to store your data in an outline. A level one headline is simply a line of text that begins with a single asterisk (<code>*</code>). A level two headline begins with two asterisks (<code>**</code>), etc&hellip;
</p>


<pre class="example">* Work
** Work hard.
Finish my project ahead of schedule.
** Ask boss for raise.
Remember to compliment him lots when asking.

* Personal
** Clean up after my kids.
Grumble while cleaning up.
** Tell my kids that they should clean up after themselves.
Laugh quietly to myself as I know it won't help.
</pre>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Adding Tags</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Org Mode allows you to further organize your tasks by adding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)">tags</a> to your todo list. Being that Org Mode is plain text, tags are words wrapped in colons (<code>:</code>).
</p>


<pre class="example">* Work                                                              :work:
** Work hard.
Finish my project ahead of schedule.
** Ask boss for raise.
Remember to compliment him lots when asking.

* Personal                                                          :personal:
** Clean up after my kids.
Grumble while cleaning up.
** Tell my kids that they should clean up after themselves.
Laugh quietly to myself when they say they will but I know they won't.
</pre>


<p>
Tags in Org Mode are inherited with the hierarchical layout of the outline. In the above example, only the two level 1 headlines have tags on their line but their children inherit these tags. For example, the task
</p><pre class="example">
** Clean up after my kids.
</pre>

<p>inherits the <code>:personal:</code> tag.
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Using Tags To Describe Multiple Facets Of A Task</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>The above use of tags was rather dull. The tags repeated data that was already in the outline hierarchy. The real power of tags becomes apparent when you use them to classify different facets of a task. For example, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> style of tagging can include context tags such as <code>:@home:</code>, as well as priority tags such as <code>:next_action:</code>. Adding these tasks, our example becomes:
</p>


<pre class="example">* Work                                                              :work:
** Work hard.                                                      :@work:@home:%next_action:
Finish my project ahead of schedule.
** Ask boss for raise.                                             :@boss:%someday:
Remember to compliment him lots when asking.

* Personal                                                          :personal:
** Clean up after my kids.                                         :@home:next_action:
Grumble while cleaning up.
** Tell my kids that they should clean up after themselves.        :@home:%why_bother:
Laugh quietly to myself as I know it won't help.
</pre>


<p>
Org Mode provides no categories of tags. For example, priority tags aren&#8217;t different than location or topic tags. Keeping with Org Mode&#8217;s plain text file format,I decided to distinguish my priority tags with a percent sign (<code>%</code>). This makes GTD&#8217;s common <code>:next_action:</code> tag <code>:%next_action:</code>.

<h2 id="sec-1">The Quantified Self</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>A couple of months ago I heard about this <del>nerdy</del> cool movement called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self">Quantified Self</a>. Its goal is improving life by leveraging organized data about yourself. The ideas behind Quantified Self are far from new. Recording your caloric intake with the aim of reaching a goal, ie: counting calories, has been around for&hellip; well for a long time.
</p>
<p>
The Quantified Self movement takes old principles, such as calorie counting, and improves upon them in two key ways:
</p><ul>
<li><b>QS is more of an atitude than an activity.</b> Tracking calories, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc&hellip; are generally targeted at a very specific goal. For example, a baseball player that records his batting performance against different pitchers is looking to be a better batter. The Quantified Self movement encourages people to look for new means of measurement, as wel as to use existing means of measurement differently, with no single goal. If you will, QS is an umbrella encompassing both old and new tools.
</li>
<li><b>Technology is a game changer.</b> Almost overnight it became possible to measure and record huge amounts of data about yourself. This ranges from relatively low-tech activities such as &#8220;checking in&#8221; to a social network during the day or using an online to-do management system to <a href="http://fitbit.com">multipurpose devices</a> that collect fairly complex data.
</li>
</ul>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">My Project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Beinng the type of person who likes <del>nerdy</del> cool things, I got all excited the moment I heard about QS. After toying around with some ideas I decided to monitor my daily activities with the goal of using my time more wisely.
</p>
<p>
I am not referring to the type of activity data you can get from your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filofax">Filofax</a> or the detailed location data that a service such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Latitude">Google Latitude</a> provides. I am going to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)">sample</a> my activity several dozen times a day.
</p>
<p>
I have a <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/time-tracking-experiments/">living document and code repository</a> that discusses my goals in more detail. I also have a <a href="https://github.com/Neil-Smithline/time-tracking-experiments/blob/1254eb4cb744305f66f547fbccfc0189db542198/README.org">snapshot</a> taken at the time of writing this.
</p>
<p>
Besides documenting my goals, I have tried, for the first time, to keep a <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/time-tracking-experiments/journal.html">journal</a> of the problem solving process as I was going through it. To reduce the overhead of maintaining a journal I have left it pretty raw so please forgive its informal presentation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Implementing Time Tracking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>The broad solution I&#8217;ve implemented in my time tracking experiment is documented in the living document and journal referenced above. To save time, I&#8217;ll not duplicate what is documented there. What I will discuss is my first solution, perhaps my first prototype of the time tracking system.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to track my activities via my ever-handy Android phone and record that data in a structured manner on my computer. Due to my personal preferences, I&#8217;m storing the data in <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">Org Mode</a> but the concepts are not limited to Org Mode.
</p>
<p>
Being that I&#8217;m storing my data in Org Mode and using Org Mode as my task manager, the solution has a very Org Mode&#8217;ish feel. I&#8217;ll try to explain enough about Org Mode so that you can follow.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">In Next posting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">

<p>I&#8217;m going to post this blog entry in two parts because my time tracking system just interrupted me, asking for a sampling of my activity. When I responded to the request I saw that I&#8217;ve used up the time I&#8217;ve allotted for blogging today so I&#8217;m putting this aside for now.
</p>
<p>
PS: I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve mentioned it before but my time tracking system provides instantaneous feedback. Every time it requests a sample of my activity it tells me how long I&#8217;ve been doing that activity as well as all the other activities I&#8217;ve done during the day. This allows me to immediately alter my behavior without waiting for longer-term analyses. Definitely cool (OK, and nerdy too).

<h2 id="sec-1">Static Blogging</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>I&#8217;ve discussed the pros and cons about static blogging <a href="http://www.neilsmithline.com/blog/categories/blogging-tech/">many times</a> before. In summary, the cons are that, well that your blog is static. No surprise there.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are ways to push the limits of static blogging so that it is not quite so static.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Website Hosting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>Unless you are self-hosting your <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blog, you are using another site to host your blog. I host mine on Github. They have a web server running 24x7 to host it. But that&#8217;s not my problem. I just use their (free) services.
</p>
<p>
I understand that website hosting isn&#8217;t a terribly exciting example of stretching the bubble of static blogging, but it is an example nonetheless. Dynamic blogs require specialized software running on their hosting computer to work. Static blogs tend to be able to run on generic web servers but there still must be a web server or there&#8217;s no blog.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">JavaScript Helps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>Out of the box, Octopress comes with some features to show your most recent tweets as well as recent activity within your <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> repositories. This is dynamic data that Octopress implements with some JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Just to be clear, by <i>dynamic data</i> I mean that the data displayed on the page may change without a republication of the blog. I am not necessarily referring to a scrolling widget or something. Just dynamic data. 
</p>
<p>
Conversely, JavaScript can be used to dynamically display static data. That is, data that is embedded in the source of the web page. Being that the data is embedded in the page&#8217;s source at or before publication time, it is assuredly <i>static data</i>.
</p>
<p>
But client-side JavaScript (ie: JavaScript running in the user&#8217;s browser) has its limits. For example, if you want to send a tweet whenever you add a new blog entry, client-side JavaScript is going to have a hard time at it.
